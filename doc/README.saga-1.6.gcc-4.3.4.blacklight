Using this SAGA installation:
=============================

Quick Guide:
------------

  For using SAGA-C++, the following environment settings are required:

      export SAGA_LOCATION=/brashear/csasaga/saga/1.6/gcc-4.3.4/
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/brashear/csasaga/external/python/2.7.1/gcc-4.3.4//lib/:/brashear/csasaga/external/boost/1.44.0/gcc-4.3.4//lib/::/brashear/csasaga/external/postgresql/9.0.2/gcc-4.3.4//lib/::/brashear/csasaga/external/sqlite3/3.6.13/gcc-4.3.4//lib/::/brashear/csasaga/saga/1.6/gcc-4.3.4//lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      export PATH=/brashear/csasaga/saga/1.6/gcc-4.3.4//bin/:$PATH

  For using the SAGA Python bindings, the follwoing settings are additionally required:

      export PATH=/brashear/csasaga/external/python/2.7.1/gcc-4.3.4//bin/:$PATH
      export PYTHONPATH=/brashear/csasaga/saga/1.6/gcc-4.3.4//lib/python2.7/site-packages/:/brashear/csasaga/saga/1.6/gcc-4.3.4//lib/python2.7/site-packages///:/brashear/csasaga/external/python/2.7.1/gcc-4.3.4//lib/2.7/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH

  Please use /brashear/csasaga/external/python/2.7.1/gcc-4.3.4//bin/python as python interpreter (the setting 
  above puts that first in your path when running 'python').


Detailed Instructions:
----------------------
 
  This README describes an automated SAGA deployment.  In particular, 
  this installation of SAGA-C++ was installed via the SAGA CSA scripts 
  (see https://svn.cct.lsu.edu/repos/saga-projects/deployment/tg-csa).

  Note that this installation procedure is at this point not depending 
  on system level software, but is instead installing all pre-requisites
  separately, in /brashear/csasaga/external.  The SAGA installation can
  be used with those dependencies by setting the folllwing environment
  variables:


    SAGA_LOCATION points to the SAGA installation root
    # export SAGA_LOCATION=/brashear/csasaga/saga/1.6/gcc-4.3.4/


    LD_LIBRARY_PATH allows to dynamically load shared libraries form this 
    path, such as SAGA package libs or adaptors.
    # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/brashear/csasaga/external/python/2.7.1/gcc-4.3.4//lib/:/brashear/csasaga/external/boost/1.44.0/gcc-4.3.4//lib/::/brashear/csasaga/external/postgresql/9.0.2/gcc-4.3.4//lib/::/brashear/csasaga/external/sqlite3/3.6.13/gcc-4.3.4//lib/::/brashear/csasaga/saga/1.6/gcc-4.3.4//lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


    PATH is used for searching for executables and scripts.
    We usually have to use our own python installation, to ensure that it is
    compatible with boost-python, which is used for our python bindings.
    # export PATH=/brashear/csasaga/saga/1.6/gcc-4.3.4//bin/:/brashear/csasaga/external/python/2.7.1/gcc-4.3.4//bin/:$PATH


    PYTHONPATH points the pyton runtime to the location of the SAGA python modules
    # export PYTHONPATH=/brashear/csasaga/saga/1.6/gcc-4.3.4//lib/python2.7/site-packages/:/brashear/csasaga/saga/1.6/gcc-4.3.4//lib/python2.7/site-packages///:/brashear/csasaga/external/python/2.7.1/gcc-4.3.4//lib/2.7/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH
