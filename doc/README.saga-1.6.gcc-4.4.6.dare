Using this SAGA installation:
=============================

Quick Guide:
------------

 For using SAGA-C++, the following environment settings are required:

     # export SAGA_LOCATION=/home/cctsg/install/saga/saga//1.6/gcc-4.4.6/
     # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/home/cctsg/install/saga/external/boost/1.44.0/gcc-4.4.6//lib/::/home/cctsg/install/saga/external/postgresql/9.0.2/gcc-4.4.6//lib/::/home/cctsg/install/saga/external/sqlite3/3.6.13/gcc-4.4.6//lib/::/home/cctsg/install/saga/saga//1.6/gcc-4.4.6//lib/:/home/cctsg/install/saga/external//python/2.7.1/gcc-4.4.6//lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     # export PATH=:/home/cctsg/install/saga/external//python/2.7.1/gcc-4.4.6//bin/::/home/cctsg/install/saga/saga//1.6/gcc-4.4.6//bin/:$PATH

 For using the SAGA Python bindings, the follwoing settings are additionally required:

     # export PATH=/home/cctsg/install/saga/external//python/2.7.1/gcc-4.4.6//bin/:$PATH
     # export PYTHONPATH=/home/cctsg/install/saga/saga//1.6/gcc-4.4.6//lib/python2.7/site-packages/:/home/cctsg/install/saga/saga//1.6/gcc-4.4.6//lib/python2.7/site-packages//BigJob-0.4.63-py2.7.egg/:/home/cctsg/install/saga/external//python/2.7.1/gcc-4.4.6//lib/2.7/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH

 Please use /home/cctsg/install/saga/external//python/2.7.1/gcc-4.4.6//bin/python as python interpreter (the setting 
 above puts that first in your path when running 'python').

Detailed Instructions:
----------------------
 
 This README describes an automated SAGA deployment.  In particular, 
 this deployment of SAGA-C++ was installed via the SAGA CSA scripts 
 (see https://svn.cct.lsu.edu/repos/saga-projects/deployment/tg-csa).

 Note that this deployment is at this point not depending on system level
 software, but instead includes all pre-requisites separately, in

   /home/cctsg/install/saga/external

 This host might nevertheless require some specific settings to use this
 deployment -- if so, those are listed below:

 

 The SAGA deployment and the accompanying dependencies can be used by setting
 the following environment variables:


   # SAGA_LOCATION points to the SAGA installation root
   export SAGA_LOCATION=/home/cctsg/install/saga/saga//1.6/gcc-4.4.6/


   # LD_LIBRARY_PATH allows to dynamically load shared libraries form this 
   # path, such as SAGA package libs or adaptors.
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/home/cctsg/install/saga/external/boost/1.44.0/gcc-4.4.6//lib/::/home/cctsg/install/saga/external/postgresql/9.0.2/gcc-4.4.6//lib/::/home/cctsg/install/saga/external/sqlite3/3.6.13/gcc-4.4.6//lib/::/home/cctsg/install/saga/saga//1.6/gcc-4.4.6//lib/:/home/cctsg/install/saga/external//python/2.7.1/gcc-4.4.6//lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


   # PATH is used for searching for executables and scripts.
   # We usually have to use our own python installation, to ensure that it is
   # compatible with boost-python, which is used for the SAGA python bindings.
   export PATH=:/home/cctsg/install/saga/external//python/2.7.1/gcc-4.4.6//bin/::/home/cctsg/install/saga/saga//1.6/gcc-4.4.6//bin/:/home/cctsg/install/saga/external//python/2.7.1/gcc-4.4.6//bin/:$PATH


   # PYTHONPATH points the pyton runtime to the location of the SAGA 
   # python modules
   export PYTHONPATH=/home/cctsg/install/saga/saga//1.6/gcc-4.4.6//lib/python2.7/site-packages/:/home/cctsg/install/saga/saga//1.6/gcc-4.4.6//lib/python2.7/site-packages//BigJob-0.4.63-py2.7.egg/:/home/cctsg/install/saga/external//python/2.7.1/gcc-4.4.6//lib/2.7/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH
