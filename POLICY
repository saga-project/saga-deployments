CSA deployment policies.
------------------------

The current default version of the CSA deployment is '1.6' (see csa_packages,
default) That version is called CSA-version, and is usually the same as the
respectively used version of saga-core.

Older deployments are kept, and will not be deleted, but will also not see any
updates and fixes, unless specifically requested by end users.

A 'unstable' CSA-version is also deployed, which may contain unstable and
experimental code (e.g. from svn trunk), and which is *not* recommended for
production usage.  That version may see frequent and unexpected updates.

The components and component-version to be installed for each CSA version are
defined in 'csa_packages'.  The target hosts for all CSA deployments are defined
in csa_hosts.

Some adaptors are not to be installed on certain hosts.  That list is also
defined in 'csa_packages', as exceptions after the individual components, like
this:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # component-name          component-source                                           target-hosts
    saga-adaptor-pbspro     https://svn.cct.lsu.edu/repos/saga-adaptors/pbspro/trunk   !ranger !lonestar
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional CSA target hosts, CSA modules, module updates and fixes can be
requested via the saga-users mailing list.  New CSA-versions and changes to
existing CSA-versions are also announced on the saga-users mailing list, if
possible with an advanced notice.  Out-of-band communication is discouraged, to
keep the CSA users in sync about the state of deployments.

It is up to the target system's administrators to specify what CSA-version (if
any) is the default on their system, and gets a system level module file or
similar - that should also be announced on the saga-user mailing list.
